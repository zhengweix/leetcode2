    You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.
    You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.
    Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

    Example 1:
    Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
    Output: 14
    Explanation:Â You start with sticks = [2,4,3].
    1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
    2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
    There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.

    Example 2:
    Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
    Output: 30
    Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].
    1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
    2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
    3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
    There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.

    Example 3:
    Input: sticks = [5]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.
