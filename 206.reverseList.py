    '''
    Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

    Input: head = [1,2]
    Output: [2,1]

    Input: head = []
    Output: []

    Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
    -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

    Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
