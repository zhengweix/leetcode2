    Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

    Example 1:
    https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

    Example 2:
    https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg
    Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
    Output: [2,0,1]

    Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    0 <= k <= 2 * 109
